# ü§ñ Auto Apply Agent - Core Functionality

## üéØ **EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED**

A streamlined, robust auto-apply agent that:
- ‚úÖ Takes your job links and parsed resume via JSON files
- ‚úÖ Uses OpenAI to intelligently navigate ANY website
- ‚úÖ Automatically extracts HTML and analyzes page structure
- ‚úÖ Creates redundancies and retry strategies
- ‚úÖ Learns and adapts to different website UIs
- ‚úÖ Auto-fills any form and applies to ANY job post
- ‚úÖ Works on ANY website with trial and error approach

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_auto_apply.txt
```

### 2. **Set Your OpenAI API Key**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. **Prepare Your Data Files**

**Jobs file (sample_jobs.json):**
```json
[
    {
        "job_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3234567890",
        "job_title": "Senior Python Developer",
        "company": "TechCorp Inc"
    },
    {
        "job_url": "https://jobs.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=abc123def456",
        "job_title": "Full Stack Engineer",
        "company": "StartupXYZ"
    }
]
```

**Resume file (sample_resume.json):**
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
    "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "React"],
    "experience_years": "5",
    "cover_letter": "I am excited to apply for this position..."
}
```

### 4. **Run the Agent**
```bash
python run_auto_apply.py
```

Or with command line arguments:
```bash
python auto_apply_agent.py --jobs-file your_jobs.json --resume-file your_resume.json --openai-key your_key
```

## üß† **How It Works - The Magic**

### **Step 1: Intelligent Page Analysis**
```python
# For each job URL, the agent:
1. Navigates to the job page
2. Extracts the current HTML
3. Sends HTML to OpenAI with this prompt:

"Analyze this job application page. What should I do next to apply for this job?
- If you see Apply button, tell me the selector to click it
- If you see a form, tell me which fields to fill
- If you see file upload, tell me how to upload resume
- If you see success page, mark as completed"
```

### **Step 2: OpenAI Provides Navigation Strategy**
```json
{
    "action_type": "click",
    "selector": ".apply-button",
    "description": "Click the main Apply button",
    "confidence": 90,
    "reasoning": "This is clearly the primary application button"
}
```

### **Step 3: Agent Executes Action**
```python
# Agent tries multiple strategies for each action:
- Try CSS selector
- Try XPath
- Try ID
- Try class name
- Try text content matching
- If all fail, ask OpenAI for alternative approach
```

### **Step 4: Continuous Learning Loop**
```python
for iteration in range(15):  # Max 15 attempts per job
    current_html = get_page_html()
    ai_guidance = ask_openai_what_to_do(current_html, job_data, previous_attempts)
    
    success = execute_ai_action(ai_guidance)
    
    if success and ai_guidance.action_type == "success":
        return "Application completed!"
    
    if not success:
        # Try alternative strategies
        alternative = ask_openai_for_alternative(current_html, failed_action)
        execute_alternative(alternative)
```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **Redundancy & Retry Logic**

### **Multiple Retry Levels:**
1. **Action Level**: Try different selectors for same element
2. **Strategy Level**: Ask OpenAI for alternative approach
3. **Session Level**: Restart browser and try again (up to 3 times)
4. **Learning Level**: Remember successful patterns for similar sites

### **Adaptive Learning:**
```python
# Agent learns from each attempt:
successful_patterns[domain] = [list_of_successful_actions]
failed_patterns[domain] = [list_of_failed_attempts]

# On next visit to similar domain:
"Previous successful patterns for this site: {successful_patterns}"
"Failed approaches to avoid: {failed_patterns}"
```

## üåê **Universal Website Compatibility**

### **Handles ANY Website Structure:**
- **LinkedIn**: Easy Apply, Full Applications, Premium features
- **Indeed**: Direct apply, company redirects, multi-step forms
- **Glassdoor**: Application forms, company career pages
- **Company Websites**: Custom career portals, ATS systems
- **Unknown Sites**: OpenAI figures out the structure on-the-fly

### **Form Field Intelligence:**
```python
# Agent automatically maps resume data to any form field:
form_mapping = {
    "name": resume_data["name"],
    "email": resume_data["email"], 
    "phone": resume_data["phone"],
    "experience": resume_data["experience_years"],
    "cover_letter": resume_data["cover_letter"]
}

# OpenAI identifies field purposes:
"This input field is for email address based on placeholder and label"
"This textarea is for cover letter based on surrounding text"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Detection Features**

### **Stealth Browser:**
- Undetected Chrome with anti-automation measures
- Random user agents and viewport sizes
- Human-like delays between actions (1-4 seconds)
- Mouse movements and scrolling simulation

### **Cookie Management:**
- Automatically saves cookies for each domain
- Loads saved cookies on return visits
- Maintains session state across applications

### **Human-like Behavior:**
- Random typing speed (50-150ms per character)
- Random pauses between form fields
- Scrolling to elements before interaction
- Multiple click strategies (normal click, JS click)

## üìä **Results & Analytics**

### **Comprehensive Tracking:**
```json
{
    "total_jobs": 10,
    "successful_applications": 8,
    "failed_applications": 2,
    "results": [
        {
            "job_title": "Senior Python Developer",
            "job_url": "https://company.com/job/123",
            "success": true,
            "navigation_steps": 6,
            "navigation_pattern": [
                {"action": "click", "selector": ".apply-btn", "success": true},
                {"action": "fill", "selector": "#email", "success": true},
                {"action": "upload", "selector": "#resume", "success": true},
                {"action": "submit", "selector": "#submit-btn", "success": true}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### **Learning Analytics:**
- Success patterns stored per domain
- Failed approaches remembered and avoided
- Navigation efficiency improves over time
- Detailed logs for debugging and optimization

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
export HEADLESS_MODE=true          # Run without browser UI
export MAX_RETRIES=3               # Retry attempts per job
export MAX_NAVIGATION_ATTEMPTS=15  # Max steps per job application
export DELAY_MIN=1                 # Minimum delay between actions
export DELAY_MAX=4                 # Maximum delay between actions
```

### **Customization:**
```python
# Modify these in auto_apply_agent.py:
self.max_retries = 3                    # Job-level retries
self.max_navigation_attempts = 15       # Steps per job
openai_model = "gpt-4"                  # OpenAI model to use
```

## üö® **Error Handling**

### **Robust Error Recovery:**
1. **Element Not Found**: Try alternative selectors, ask OpenAI for new approach
2. **Page Load Issues**: Wait, retry, refresh if needed
3. **Form Submission Errors**: Validate fields, retry submission
4. **Login Required**: Detect and handle (if credentials provided)
5. **CAPTCHA Detected**: Wait and continue (manual intervention may be needed)
6. **Bot Detection**: Restart browser, change user agent, add delays

### **Logging:**
- All actions logged to `auto_apply.log`
- Detailed error messages with context
- Navigation patterns saved for analysis
- Screenshots on errors (optional)

## üìù **Example Usage**

### **Basic Usage:**
```python
from auto_apply_agent import AutoApplyAgent

agent = AutoApplyAgent(openai_api_key="your_key")
results = agent.apply_to_jobs("jobs.json", "resume.json")

print(f"Applied to {results['successful_applications']} jobs successfully!")
```

### **Advanced Usage:**
```python
# Custom configuration
agent = AutoApplyAgent(
    openai_api_key="your_key",
    headless=False,  # Show browser for debugging
)

# Set custom retry limits
agent.max_retries = 5
agent.max_navigation_attempts = 20

# Run applications
results = agent.apply_to_jobs("my_jobs.json", "my_resume.json")
```
